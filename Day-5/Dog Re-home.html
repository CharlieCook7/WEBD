        <p>ARS Shelters have plenty of canine companions just waiting for a new home. <br>Here are some that you can take with you to give a forever home:</p><br>
        <img src="https://marleyshope.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/slide-3.jpg">
        <p>Marley is a 4-year-old shih tzu. She's often afraid of new people, <br>but once she warms up to you, she loves to hang around with <br>you and follow you around all day</p>
        <br>

        <p>Spike is a 7-year-old pitbull. He likes his space before he warms <br>up to you, and might act a little aggressive if you don't give it to him, <br>but once he's used to you, he's one of the most gentle and <br>affectionate dogs you've ever met.</p>

        <p>Max is a 6-year-old mixed breed dog. Though sometimes he'll <br>cuddle right up to you, he often enjoys to be left to his own <br>devices. Just watch he doesn't get into any mischief!</p>
