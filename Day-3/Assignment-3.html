        <h2>Paragraph Formatting</h2>
            <p>You can use BR tags to put a line break in text, this can be helpful for things like poetry</p>
            <p style="color:#5a00f7"> Roses are red <br> Violets are blue <br> No they aren't, they're <b>violet</b> <br> <i>That's why they're called violets</i></p>
            <p>The pre tag preserves text the way it is typed in the source code. Here's some text in a pre tag...</p>
            <pre>This text contains
A bunch of different lines
And some      space      between      the      text
Which is preserved by the pre tag
But not the p tag
            </pre>
            <p>...And here's the same text in a p tag</p>
            <p>This text contains
                A bunch of different lines
                And some      space      between      the      text
                Which is preserved by the pre tag
                But not the p tag</p> <hr>
        <h2>Text Formatting</h2>
            <p><sup>Here's some superscript with the sup tag, you can use this to write things like exponents</sup></p>
            <p>3<sup>2</sup></p>
            <p><sub>And here's some subscript with the sub, you can use this to write things like chemical formulas</sub></p>
            <p>H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
            <p>The b, strong, or em tag <b>bolds</b> a piece of text, used to put emphasis on <b>important</b> words/sections</p>
            <p>The small tag makes text <small>smaller,</small> and can be used for things like <small>notes</small></p>
            <p>The i tag puts text in <i>italics,</i> to indicate it should be read in a different tone. you've probably seen it used in stories to denote a character's <i>thoughts</i></p>
            <p>The ins tag <ins>underlines</ins> a piece of text, used to denote text that has been <ins>inserted</ins> into the document, or to just give some extra importance to a certain word/section</p>
            <p>The mark tag <mark>highlights</mark> a piece of text, used to draw the reader's attention</p>
            <p>The del tag <del>strikes a line</del> through a piece of text, used to denote a piece ot text that has been <del>deleted</del> from the document</p> <hr>

        <h2>Quotation/Citation Elements</h2>

            <p>A BDO tag can be used to change the direction that text is written. This can be helpful for languages like Hebrew where text is written from right to left</p>
            <bdo dir="RTL">גזר לורם איפסום</bdo>
            <p>What does <abbr title="Bi-Directional Override">BDO</abbr> stand for, you may ask? You can use an abbr tag to allow users to mouse over an abbreviation, displaying what it stands for as a tooltip</p>
            <p>The blockquote tag denotes text that is quoted from another source. Blockquote text is usually indented in browsers</p>
            <blockquote cite="http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/a1/bee-movie-script-transcript-seinfeld.html">According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.<br> The bee, of course, flies anyways. Because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.</blockquote>
            <p>The cite tag is used to credit the title of a creative work. Text in a cite element is usaually put in italics</p>

            <p><cite>Starry Night</cite> painted by Vincent van Gogh</p>
            <p>The q tag puts text in <q>quotation marks</q> and is usually used for short quotations</p>
            <p>Neil deGrasse Tyson once said <q>The good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it.</q></p>
            <p>And finally, the address tag is used for contact information for the author of the document. Text in an address element is rendered in <i>italics,</i> and has a line break before and after it</p>
